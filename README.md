<h2>Instructions:</h2>

- Make sure to print at 100% infill and let the plates cool before removing from the printing bed, otherwise they will end up distorted when you pull them off.
- I've included a 3mm version that should offer more sturdyness but keep in mind that the thickness of the aluminum plates is going to be 1.5mm
- Lastly, the thumb key is inteded to rest on the 1.25u key, not the 2.25u one.
